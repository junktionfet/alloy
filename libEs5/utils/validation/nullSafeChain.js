/**
 * This augments `chain` with a null check done before running the rightValidator.
 * See chain for more info.
 *
 * For most validators, we want the validation to be optional (i.e. allow null or
 * undefined values). To accomplish this, the validator needs to have a check
 * at the begining of the function, short circuiting the validation logic and
 * returning value if value is null or undefined. `default` and `required` do not
 * want this null check though. Indeed, `default` should return the default value
 * if value is null, and `required` should throw an error if value is null.
 *
 * So to keep from having to have a null check in front of most validators, this
 * function allows you to chain a rightValidator that needs to have a null check.
